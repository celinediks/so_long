So long was my first visual project using the 42 MLX library. 


### Norm writing
This project is written in accordance to the norm of school 42. Some of the most important norm rules are:
- Each function has a maximum of 25 lines
- One single variable declaration per line, all variables on top of the function 
- After the variable declarations, a newline will split them with the rest of the function
- No for loops allowed
